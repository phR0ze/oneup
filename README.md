## Backlog

### Next
*  Working API
  * Request tracing
  * Integrate API with UI

* Harden CORS
* API is not logging requests
* Reformat codebase to 4 char indent
* Audit log when and what
* API security

### Sometime
* Add user profile image support
* API Swagger specification
* Support running locally only without server
* Multi-tenant tracked by login with JWT tokens

## User Journeys
All API endpoints are protected TODO??

### First run login
The first time the user runs the client application they will be presented with an option to connect 
to the backend server and create their user.

1. 

## Dev Env
The `flake.nix` file in the root of the project provides a development environment that can be set up 
running `nix develop`. The development environment is responsible for providing the correct versions 
of dependencies for this project.

Currently this is a mix of my local system and NixOS requirements for local library lookup, but I 
plan on calling out all the other dependencies eventually.

### NixOS Dev Shell
To recreate the development environment in NixOS you can simply open a shell and run:
```bash
$ cd ~/Projects/oneup
$ nix develop
```

### VSCode for Rust API
Start VSCode to work on the API with:

1. Set up [NixOS Dev Shell](#nixos-dev-shell)

2. Lauch VSCode in that shell with:
   ```bash
   $ cd ~/Projects/oneup
   $ code server
   ```

### VSCode for Flutter UI

1. Set up [NixOS Dev Shell](#nixos-dev-shell)

2. Lauch VSCode in that shell with:
   ```bash
   $ cd ~/Projects/oneup
   $ code flutter
   ```

2. Build and run the flutter UI locally simply press `F5`

3. Flutter might need a clean rebuild in some cases, run:
   ```bash
   $ cd ~/Projects/oneup/flutter
   $ flutter clean
   $ flutter build linux
   ```
